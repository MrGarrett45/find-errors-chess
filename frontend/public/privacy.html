      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p>This policy explains how Theory Gap collects and uses data.</p>

      <h2>1. Data We Collect</h2>
      <p>
        We collect account details from Auth0 (such as email and name), usage
        metrics, and chess analysis inputs needed to provide the service.
      </p>

      <h2>2. How We Use Data</h2>
      <p>
        We use data to operate, maintain, and improve Theory Gap, provide
        customer support, and enforce plan limits.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Payments</h2>
      <p>
        Payments are processed by Stripe. We do not store full payment card
        details on our servers.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Sharing</h2>
      <p>
        We do not sell your personal data. We share data only with trusted
        providers required to deliver the service (such as hosting and payment
        processing) or when required by law.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
      <p>
        We retain data as long as needed to provide the service and comply with
        legal obligations. You may request deletion where applicable.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Security</h2>
      <p>
        We use industry-standard safeguards to protect data, including access
        controls and encryption in transit.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Your Rights</h2>
      <p>
        Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights to access, correct,
        or delete your data. Contact support for requests.
      </p>

      <h2>8. Changes</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this policy from time to time. Changes will be posted on
        this page.
