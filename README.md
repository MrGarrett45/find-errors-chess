Pull in your chess games from chess.com (planning to add lichess) and analyze them to find positions where you commonly make mistakes

Under development

ToDo:
1. Add lichess support
2. Add caching so you don't re run stale analysis. Also cache errors
3. Figure out what's going on with discrepancy between local analysis and docker container anaylsis
5. Stripe
6. Get custom domain
7. Differentiate on frontend between blunder/suboptimal/etc
8. Improve UI
9. Handle scenario for analysis hanging
10. Differentiate on frontend between common bad openings
