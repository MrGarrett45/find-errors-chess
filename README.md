Pull in your chess games from chess.com (planning to add lichess) and analyze them to find positions where you commonly make mistakes

Under development

ToDo:
1. Add lichess support
2. Add caching so you don't re run stale analysis. Also cache errors
3. On positions page make it so you can hit arrow keys to move back and forth through positions
4. Figure out what's going on with discrepancy between local analysis and docker container anaylsis
5. Give users options for how they want to run analysis (time, depth, etc)
