Pull in your chess games from chess.com (planning to add lichess) and analyze them to find positions where you commonly make mistakes

Under development

ToDo:
1. Add lichess support
2. Figure out how to show SAN notation moves on the frontend, uci is unintuitive for regular players
3. Add caching so you don't re run stale analysis
4. On positions page make it so you can hit arrow keys to move back and forth through positions
