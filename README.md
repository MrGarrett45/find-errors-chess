Pull in your chess games from chess.com (planning to add lichess) and analyze them to find positions where you commonly make mistakes

Under development

ToDo:
1. Add lichess support
2. Frontend (0 -> 1 Request name, kick off process, track progress)
3. Add caching so you don't re run stale analysis
